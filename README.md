Hi guys, I was studying some JavaScript and decided to put my learnings into practice. 
So, I made this mini project to showcase what I learned about JavaScript for the web.

To ensure that all files work perfectly, a connection to the pages is required. Therefore,
in my project, I used the Visual Code extension (Live Server).
